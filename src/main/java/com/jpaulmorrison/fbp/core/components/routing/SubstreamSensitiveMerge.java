/**
 * First-come, first-served - sensitive to substreams
 * The reason for this component is that you do not want its downstream process to receive "overlapping" substreams,
 *  so incoming substreams cannot simply be merged into one stream; the input ports (actually input port array elements) have to be
 *  separate, and the component decides which substream to process completely first, then another (probably from a different
 *  array element), and so on...
